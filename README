This is early proof-of-concept implementation. The goal is to provide access to OpenNI classes 
that are currently not available in ManagedNite.dll. In particular to generator nodes such as
ImageGenerator, DepthGenerator and ScaneAnalyzer. 

Short term todo:
- The library should be renamed to ManagedOpenNI.dll (or maybe SharpOpenNI, nOpenNI?)
- The namespace should be renamed to ManagedOpenNI (or just OpenNI)
- Drop the XnM prefix from class names.
- Add missing functions.

To build the ManagedNiteEx project you might heve to fix the additional include and link directories
for the C++ compiler. Add paths to c:\Program Files\OpenNI\Include 
and c:\Program Files\OpenNI\Lib respectively. 

To build the samples you will have to reference these external libraries:
- WPF Toolkit  http://wpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/40535
- Helix 3D Toolkit http://helixtoolkit.codeplex.com/
- SlimDX http://slimdx.org/download.php
